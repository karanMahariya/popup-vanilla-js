# popup-vanilla-js


# The entire code must be written in vanilla Javascript (including HTML generation, CSS implementation and JS as well).
# No third party plugins(JS & CSS both) should be used to develop the assignment.
# The code should be in the manner that if we run the code from the browser console on any website, the desired output should be visible. Also, this should not break the current functionality of the existing website.
# The requirement should be correctly implemented for both desktop (exit intent popup) and mobile (popup should be visible after 5 second) devices.
# The form validation must be applied for all input fields including the checkbox. The validation must be in vanilla JS with proper email, name and checkbox field validation without using third party plugins.
# The popup form once submitted or closed, should not be visible after running the code multiple times.
# You can use the google font library of your choice.
